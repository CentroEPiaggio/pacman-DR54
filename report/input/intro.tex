% why the problem we are dealing with is important
One of the main reasons that makes autonomous grasping tasks very challenging is that object properties required for grasp planning like shape and surface properties are not known \emph{a priori}. This requires robots to perceive objects around them based on sesnory information.

General guidelines : \citet{Bajcsy1989Machine}

Active visual perception: \citet{Bajcsy1988Active}

Vision-based exploration is the most studied, perhaps due to its non-invasive nature, which avoids the contact between rigid bodies which is the cause of most headaches in physics modelling, simulation and control.

As very well said by \citet{Petrovskaya2011Global}, even when initial works date back to the 80's, tactile perception has not been addressed as deeply as the non-invasive counterpart, visual perception. Besides the need of being actively controlled, tactile sensors typically required ad-hoc mechanical devices.

``Touch-based perception has not been studied in as much depth
as vision because standardized touch sensors are not as easily
available. In many situations, tactile sensors have to be hand
crafted specifically for the robot and the task. This complicates
comparisons between methods and slows progress in tactile
perception. However, recently there has been a surge of interest
in the field due to the necessity of touch-based perception in
service applications''

Whereas \citet{Petrovskaya2011Global} is more interested in the object pose estimation problem, here we are more interested in the object shape modelling, sort of in the mapping of rather than localization in a SLAM problem.

On active touch sensing \citet{Prescott2011Active}

Differentiate from active touch for localization, here another example: \citet{Hebert2013Next}.

Justify the use of a intrinsic tactile sensor over a tactile array.

ITS are more precise and less noisy. It provides the contact normal directly in sensor frame.

Tactile arrays provide multiple-point measurements. They do not provide directly the normal in sensor frame, forward kinematics is required over noisy joint measurements, or in fixed configurations that limit exploration mobility. Up to a point that a typically a complex framework is needed to exploit its grasping and touching properties % cite http://www.roboticsproceedings.org/rss09/p45.pdf?

With ITS, the computation will be trivial. The disadvantage is that it is a single-point measurement. Poking strategies, like in~\citet{Petrovskaya2011Global}, or trajectories strategies like in~\citet{Rosales2014Active}.

% They claim that touch sensing is low bandwith, local, sequential process with better signal-to-noise ratio than vision.

% Vision is global, has high bandwidth, and is noisy. Touch is a low bandwidth, local, sequential process with better noise properties than vision.

Shape representation and descriptor review \citet{Zhang2004Review}

In this work, we provide a systematic methodology to plan the next-best tactile exploratory action. The tactile exploratory action is intrinsically a contact hypothesis that need to be accepted or discarded after execution. Should the result be any of the two, it helps to improve the object shape prediction up to a pre-specified variability. In contrast to \citet{Bjorkman2013Enhancing}, we propose the same shape representation as descriptor for classification purposes using shape matching techniques~\citep{Belongie2002Shape}. The scope and problem statement is detailed in Sect.~\ref{sec:scope}. The proposed solution is broaden in Sect.~\ref{sec:solution}. The experimental results and discusion is presented in Sect.~\ref{sec:experiments}. Finally, the conclusions and points deserving further attention as given in Sect.~\ref{sec:conclusions}.
