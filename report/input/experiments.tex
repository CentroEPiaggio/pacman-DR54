We repeat the exploratory probe given in~\citet{Rosales2014Active}. The probe is composed of a semispherical tip (radius $2$cm) on top of an ATI Nano 17 and an in-parallel passive compliant coupler to safely attach it as the end-effector of the 7 degrees of freedom KUKA LWR 4+ robot arm.

The object is grasped by a soft-hand. The 
assumption that the object is unknown holds to the adaptability of the hand.
There is no need to have a precise model of the object, but a rough 
approximation of the shape. The hand softness will do the rest. This setup
complies with the specifications given in Sect.~\ref{sec:equipment}.
