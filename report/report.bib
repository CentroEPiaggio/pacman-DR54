  abstract =      {The situation arising in path planning under
                   kinematic constraints, where the valid configurations
                   define a manifold embedded in the joint ambient
                   space, can be seen as a limit case of the well-known
                   narrow corridor problem. With kinematic constraints,
                   the probability of obtaining a valid configuration by
                   sampling in the joint ambient space is not low but
                   null, which complicates the direct application of
                   sampling-based path planners. This paper presents the
                   {AtlasRRT} algorithm, which is a planner especially
                   tailored for such constrained systems that builds on
                   recently developed tools for higher-dimensional
                   continuation. These tools provide procedures to
                   define charts that locally parametrize a manifold and
                   to coordinate the charts, forming an atlas that fully
                   covers it. {AtlasRRT} simultaneously builds an atlas
                   and a bidirectional rapidly exploring random tree
                   ({RRT}), using the atlas to sample configurations and
                   to grow the branches of the {RRTs}, and the {RRTs} to
                   devise directions of expansion for the atlas. The
                   efficiency of {AtlasRRT} is evaluated in several
                   benchmarks involving high-dimensional manifolds
                   embedded in large ambient spaces. The results show
                   that the combined use of the atlas and the {RRTs}
                   produces a more rapid exploration of the
                   configuration space manifolds than existing
                   approaches.},
