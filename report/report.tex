\begin{abstract}
Gaussian Process are state-of-the-art techniques for regression, and recently been used for shape representation. They have been recently used to model manifolds and implicitly defined surfaces. The second using thin-plate interpolation and variational concepts.
%Moreover, shape matching methods are useful for object recognition.
Continuation methods are used in many ways, typically to find local parametrizations of implicitly defined manifolds. Each parametrization is called a chart, and it should provide a one-to-one map from the parametric space onto the manifold, that is, it should cover an area over the manifold. The manifold is then globally parametrized or fully covered by a collection of charts properly coordinated to not overlap the covered regions called an atlas. The names suggest already the navigation purpose.
Rapidly-exploring random trees are a probabilistic framework to explore complex search spaces. The idea is to grow trees at random or biased directions to ``evenly'' the space from a root node. However, using several root nodes is also possible.
The two latter has been succesfully combined to explore the interesting regions of the manifold for the problem at hand, introduced as AtlasRRT.
This is a well-suited framework for object shape modelling and exploraion via tactile actions, as we propose the GPAtlasRRT strategy for that. The basic idea is to use Gaussian Process implicit surfaces for the shape representation, and then explore the relevant regions of the shape that will improve the model via continuation methods and rapidly-epxloring random tree techniques.
