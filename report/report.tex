\begin{abstract}
Information on object shape is a fundamental parameter for robot grasps to be successful. However, incomplete perception and noisy measurements impede obtaining accurate models of novel objects. Especially when vision and touch simultaneously are envisioned for learning object models, a representation able to incorporate prior shape knowledge and heterogeneous uncertain sensor feedback %flowing from different modalities 
is paramount to fusing them in a coherent way. Moreover, by embedding a notion of uncertainty in shape representation allows to more effectively bias the active search for new tactile cues. %to improve the model.
In this paper, we firstly represent the shape of an object as a Gaussian Process (GP). Then, using the concept that the $0$-levelset of the GP --- the surface of the approximated object --- is an implicitly defined manifold, we extend the AtlasRRT algorithm to simultaneously: (i) build an atlas via continuation methods that locally parameterizes the object and that is used to select the next-best touch, and (ii) use an RRT-like strategy to devise directions for the expansion of the atlas to trade completeness in the exploration for efficiency. We integrate this strategy in a framework for iterative learning the object shape and implement a tactile exploration scenario in the bimanual setting of our Vito robot. The experimental results confirm that the devised methodology yields better models and does it with a reduced number of touches.


%Gaussian Process are state-of-the-art techniques for regression, and recently been used for shape representation. They have been recently used to model manifolds and implicitly defined surfaces. The second using thin-plate interpolation and variational concepts.
%%Moreover, shape matching methods are useful for object recognition.
%Continuation methods are used in many ways, typically to find local parametrizations of implicitly defined manifolds. Each parametrization is called a chart, and it should provide a one-to-one map from the parametric space onto the manifold, that is, it should cover an area over the manifold. The manifold is then globally parametrized or fully covered by a collection of charts properly coordinated to not overlap the covered regions called an atlas. The names suggest already the navigation purpose.
%Rapidly-exploring random trees are a probabilistic framework to explore complex search spaces. The idea is to grow trees at random or biased directions to ``evenly'' the space from a root node. However, using several root nodes is also possible.
%The two latter has been succesfully combined to explore the interesting regions of the manifold for the problem at hand, introduced as AtlasRRT.
%This is a well-suited framework for object shape modelling and exploraion via tactile actions, as we propose the GPAtlasRRT strategy for that. The basic idea is to use Gaussian Process implicit surfaces for the shape representation, and then explore the relevant regions of the shape that will improve the model via continuation methods and rapidly-epxloring random tree techniques.
