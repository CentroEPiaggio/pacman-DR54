\begin{abstract}
Information on object shape is a fundamental parameter for robot-object interaction to be successful. However, incomplete perception and noisy measurements impede obtaining accurate models of novel objects. Especially when vision and touch simultaneously are envisioned for learning object models, a representation able to incorporate prior shape knowledge and heterogeneous uncertain sensor feedback %flowing from different modalities 
is paramount to fusing them in a coherent way. Moreover, by embedding a notion of uncertainty in shape representation allows to more effectively bias the active search for new tactile cues. %to improve the model.
In this paper, we firstly represent the shape of an object as a Gaussian Process (GP). Then, using the concept that the $0$-levelset of the GP --- the surface of the approximated object --- is an implicitly defined manifold, we extend the AtlasRRT algorithm to simultaneously: (i) build an atlas via continuation methods that locally parameterizes the object and that is used to select the next-best touch, and (ii) use an RRT-like strategy to devise directions for the expansion of the atlas to trade completeness in the exploration for efficiency. We integrate this strategy in a framework for iterative learning the object shape and implement a tactile exploration scenario in the bimanual setting of our Vito robot. The experimental results confirm that the devised strategy yields better models than those obtained with a naive strategy, and does it with a reduced number of touches. %% this depends on how we finally validate our strategy
